# Refactor-Startercode-Challenge

##Description 

I was given the task to refactor the starter code to utitlize semantic HTML elements. I also refactored the CSS in order to have less characters while being easier to read. The HTML now reads in a logistical sense and the images have alt tags to improve accessibility within the HTML. The heading attributes fall in sequential order and the title is clear and concise. 

## Usage example

<img src="http://github.com/lalu423/refactoring-project/blob/main/assets/images/horiseon_refactor_sample.png" width = "500">
